Movie Recommendation System
Analysis and Recommendations for Movie Data
This project involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of movie data,
focusing on factors such as profitability, language-based gross analysis,
and comparisons between gross and profit across different genres. The
budget, gross, and profit of movies are calculated using specific formulas.
A recommendation system based on actors, movies, and genres is
developed. Social media popularity metrics, including votes, reviews, and
Facebook likes, are incorporated. The project also includes creating a
function summarizing an actor's time period, maximum/minimum gross,
average IMDb ratings, and common genres. Key takeaways encompass
understanding missing values treatment, feature engineering, data
manipulation, and recommendations based on content and similarity.
The project provides insights into the correlation between various factors
in the film industry.
